                The beautiful city of Kandy is located in the hill country of Sri Lanka and is of great importance to its people. UNESCO even declared it as the 450th world heritage site, and the 5th heritage site in Sri Lanka,
                and thereafter called it The Sacred City Of Kandy. Kandy is of great importance, due to its historic and religious significance. It is said that Sri lanka has had the longest royal dynasty than any other country
                as it started from 543 BC and lasted until 1815. The final royal kingdom of Sri Lanka was Kandy and held out against its invaders until its king Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was captured and imprisoned in 1815 and was
                therefore Sri Lanka's last royal capital. 
                <br><br>
                Kandy also houses a tooth of Lord Buddha in the Sri Dalada Maligawa, or commonly known as The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. It is therefore an internationally recognized and renowned pilgrimage site which draws 
                in tourists from all over the world

                    <h3>The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic</h3>

                    <p>
                        Originally built in the year 1595 by King vimaladharmasuriya i of Kandy. The temple survived many attack from both the Portuguese and British invaders and to this date remains as an icon landmark and testament to the former imperial ruling of this city.
                        Conveniently located at the heart of Kandy the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, is by far the most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Sri Lanka and many traditions and parts of the Sinhalese culture revolves around it. The temple is so significant to the people that once a president is elected 
                        in the country, they travel to Kandy once their inauguration ceremony is complete in order to pay their respects and receive blessings.
                        <br> <br>
                        The temple has multiple careful carvings depicting many different scenarios. Each carving is a delicate masterpiece but what often draws visitors attention are the moonstones carvings found at each gate. The ancient tooth itself lies in the main chamber in a Golden casket studded with Gems, 
                        this casket is mainly used during the Esala Perahera in order to transport and keep the relic safe. The temple is highlighted as a must visit venue in Kandy, as tourists may then catch glimpses of and watch Buddhist rituals, pay their respects to the tooth, visit the ruins of the old palace and inspect the antiques and artifacts which survived
                        and do much more.

                    <img class="img" src="Images/Kandy 3.jpg" alt="King Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe being handed over">
                    <p>
                        For more than 2 centuries, Kandy had protected itself from all 3 foreign invaders, The Dutch, the Portuguese and the British. With the help of the thick jungle surrounding it, tremendous mountains and rivers, the old Kandyan kings repelled many attacks and safeguarded their way of life.
                        This makes Kandy an important historic location as many historic events occurred during the Kandyan period, according to the stories Sri Vikrama Rajasinghe alone ordered the execution of many ministers and commoners as he was getting more and more paranoid. In the year 1815 the last Kandyan king, 
                        Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was handed over the British and members of his court signed the Kandyan Convention. This act ended the longest royal dynasty in history and bought Sri Lanka completely under the British.
                        <br><br>
                        However even after the treaty was signed, there were rebellions and many attempts to overthrow the British and reinstate a king once again. Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, finally gained Independence On February 4th, 1948.

                        Within the same area of the Royal palace and the sacred temple, lies the Hatara Devala (Four temples) which are a tribute and built in honor of 4 Hindu gods, they are Vishnu, Natha, Pattini and Kataragama. While the first 3 temples are situated very close to each other and near the Temple of the tooth, the
                        Kataragama temple is about 10 mins away, in the town. 
                        <br><br>
                        The Natha Devale, located closest to the Temple of the tooth, is said to be the oldest standing building in Kandy. According to legend, the olden Kandyan kings would present themselves in front of this Devale and select a name from which they are to be called by.
