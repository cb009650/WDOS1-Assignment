                Polonnaruwa was the second capital and second most primeval city of Sri Lanka after Anuradhapura was captured and defeated. This made Polonnaruwa the capital of Sri Lanka from the 11th to the 13th century.
                <br><br>
                King Chola Rajaraja took over Polonnaruwa and King Vijayabahu casted out the Chola Empire, a southern Indian Tamil empire. However, in the 12th century when King Parakramabahu took over Polonnaruwa he built 
                many beautiful palaces and gardens. People may still see some of these ancient buildings and monuments, and to this day many architects are astonished by beautiful architecture which remains. Polonnaruwa is a heritage
                Site mainly due to its archeological ancient technological superiority prominence

                    <p>
                        Gal Vihara which translates to Rock Monastery, is a place which consist of many Buddha statues carved into the rocks. Records state that this site has the closest illustration of Lord Buddha carved into the stone. There are 4 intimately carved statues 
                        and 3 massive but beautiful statues carved into the rocks.
                        <br><br>
                        Created under the ruling of King Parakramabahu, the detail and effort put into these sculptures still amaze many people worldwide and speak volumes of the capabilities of the sculptures at that time. Each statue depicts a stage of Lord Buddha's life and 
                        tells his story. This is a very popular destination for tourists and locals to visit and will leave you stunned and amazed

                    <p>
                        Another major tourist destination in Polonnaruwa is the royal palace of king Parakramabahu. His palace is known to have 1000 chambers and is 7 floors tall. Only the ruins can be seen now as the Chola dynasty destroyed the palace during the war and the palace 
                        was never rebuilt again. Although only the ruins are left, you can still see the stairway and walls which are about 30m tall. 
                        <br><br>
                        It is almost impossible to believe that such a beautiful and great structure was built in the late 1100s and how they managed to build it so perfectly. The ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa are often praised for their architectural superiority  and advanced buildings
