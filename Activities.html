                        the founder and teacher of Buddhism, who once visited Sri Lanka. During a Perahera dozens of elephants are shrouded in glistening royal attire and dance to the sound of the music, while parading the streets to show everyone how majestic they are. 
                        Surrounding them are legions of dancers, flag bearers, musicians and many other different types of artists showing off their art forms and skills, amazing everyone and bringing the streets to life.
