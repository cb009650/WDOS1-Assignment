                            Unawatuna beach also known as the “banana shaped” beach in located in the Galle district and has a beautiful shade of clear blue water and palm trees. It is also one of the most famous beaches in Sri Lanka and is best visited during the months December to April. Tragically Unawatuna was ruined by the tsunami in 2004 
                            but was rebuilt again to its former glory by hardworking citizens. 
                            <br><br>
                            Unawatuna Centre is an amazing place to go shopping with gorgeous jewelry and souvenirs to buy and delicious food to eat which will make your mouth water. For a quieter and more peaceful vibe, check out the Jungle Beach or Secret Beach Mirissa. For someone who loves coral reefs, palm trees, 
                            sun kissed sand and crystal-clear water, a few days here would make you never want to leave!
