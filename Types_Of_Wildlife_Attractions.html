                    One of the very few, but most beautiful rainforests of Sri Lanka. Sinharaja rain forest is a sanctuary to many varieties of plants, birds and animals that take 
                    refuge in the moist and murky rain forest.<br><br>
                    Hiking through this piece of Eden will leave you truly mesmerized and in awe, you may follow the gentle streams that lead to exhilarating waterfalls, while a cool 
                    breeze dances with the trees, visitors may spot all the exotic birds and look out for different types of reptiles and mammals lurking in the forest. With over 130 endemic species
                    living throughout Sinharaja rain forest, visitors have the opportunity to observe as many as they may spot. Therefore be prepared for an unforgettable experience.
                    <br><br>
                    The forest has a rich and vibrant history which dates back 1000s of years. The Sinharaja rain forest however has been diluted from 
                    its former glory, throughout the years due to colonizers and different industries taking up parts of land. Yet the small piece that remains, still stands as symbol for Sri Lankas beauty 
                    and grace. UNESCO declared the rain forest as a World heritage site in 1988 as majority of trees are considered to be rare, further many of the animals in the reservation  
                    are endangered and therefore must be protected.

                    Anawilundawa Wetlands sanctuary is a home to a range of many interesting butterflies and over a 100 different species of birds, both residential and migratory. These exotic birds can easily be spotted in the sanctuary during different times of the year.
                    It is therefore a famous site for bird-watchers and even nature lovers as the flora and fauna in Anawilundawa Wetlands is astonishing. 
                    <br><br>
                    Originally, around the 12th century an irrigation system was in place which connected a series of large tanks throughout Anawilundawa in order to maintain paddy fields and other vegetations in the area. However 
                    over time these irrigation systems broke down and the area is know fed by flood waters. Yet, the tanks have created a natural habitat for a variety of species including birds, fish and reptiles and still continued to 
                    irrigate nearby fields.
